# Scalar CLI

WIP, not published yet

## Installation

Hey, `scalar` works just fine, but if you really want to become friends you should install the CLI:

```bash
npm -g install @scalar/cli
```

If you just want to test the CLI, prefix all commands with `npx @scalar/cli` instead of just `scalar`.

## Commands

### format

The given JSON file will be formatted with Prettier.

```bash
scalar format openapi.json
```

### validate

To check whether your OpenAPI file adheres to the Swagger 2.0, OpenAPI 3.0 or OpenAPI 3.1 specification, run the following command:

```bash
scalar validate openapi.json
```

### share

To quickly share an OpenAPI file or reference with someone, you can use the share command:

```bash
scalar share openapi.json
```

This will upload your OpenAPI file to the [Scalar Sandbox](https://sandbox.scalar.com/) to give you a public reference URL and a public URL to your OpenAPI JSON file.

### init

If youâ€™re tired of passing the file name again and again, just configure it once:

```bash
scalar init
```

This will create a `scalar.toml` file for you. All commands will use the configured OpenAPI file by default.

## Options

### --version

If you want to check which version of the CLI is installed, just run this:

```bash
scalar --version
```

### --help

```bash
scalar --help
```

# Scalar CLI

WIP

## Usage

### Format JSON files

```bash
npx @scalar/cli format openapi.json
```

### Lint OpenAPI files

```bash
npx @scalar/cli lint openapi.json
```

### Upload OpenAPI files to the Scalar Sandbox

```bash
npx @scalar/cli share openapi.json
```

## Check which version is installed

```bash
npx @scalar/cli version
```

## Installation

Hey, `npx @scalar/cli` works just fine, but if you really want to become friends you should install the CLI:

```bash
npm -g install @scalar/cli
```
